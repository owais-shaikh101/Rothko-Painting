# Rothko Painting

This project simulates the visual composition of a Rothko-style painting using HTML and CSS. The design features layered rectangles in various sizes and colors, reminiscent of the artist's signature abstract style. The elements are arranged within a frame to create a visually appealing, modern interpretation of Rothko's work.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The artwork is displayed within a frame that adjusts to various screen sizes.
- **Abstract Composition**: Three div elements are used to create overlapping and blurred rectangular shapes, mimicking Rothko's use of color fields.
- **CSS Styling**: The project uses CSS to manage layout, color, and blur effects to achieve a modern minimalist style.

## Files

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the page, including the canvas and frame.
- **styles.css**: Defines the visual styling for the canvas, frame, and individual elements using properties such as color, shadow, border-radius, and blur.
